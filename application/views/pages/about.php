<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Vehicle Reservation System is the final project for IS226 Web Information System, Master of Information Systems at the University of the Philippines Open University.</p>
<p>Developed by: Jeff Manhulad and Enzo Cerbas</p>

<p>A small car rental business operating in Valencia City, Bukidnon is looking for an MIS system that
can ease their burden in reservation tracking and eventually support their expansion goals.
One of their pain points is the challenges in tracking car unit availability anytime and anywhere
they want especially because currently they are manually tallying their reservations on a planner.
The current manual system is time-consuming and is unreliable, so we are proposing the Vehicle
Reservation System (VRS) which will help their reservation system faster and accessible anytime,
anywhere. </p>
<p>Aside from the faster enquiry of available units, the VRS will also enable the car rental owner to
view a summary of the income of their vehicles per month for easy tracking and accounting.
Having online presence by having a website helps businesses compete in todayâ€™s world of techsavvy
and social media-savvy millennials so VRS is a timely solution for SMEs like them looking to
expand.</p>
